			<h2>THE VAMPIRE’S ELEVENTH STORY.<br />
  WHICH PUZZLES RAJA VIKRAM.</h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">There</span>
is a queer time coming, O Raja Vikram!—a
queer time coming (said the Vampire), a queer
time coming. Elderly people like you talk abundantly
about the good old days that were, and
about the degeneracy of the days that are. I wonder
what you would say if you could but look forward a
few hundred years.</p>

<p>Brahmans shall disgrace themselves by becoming
soldiers, and being killed, and Serviles (Shudras)
shall dishonour themselves by wearing the thread of
the twice-born, and by refusing to be slaves; in fact,
society shall be all ‘mouth’ and mixed castes.<a id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> The
courts of justice shall be disused; the great works of
peace shall no longer be undertaken; wars shall last
six weeks, and their causes shall be clean forgotten;
the useful arts and great sciences shall die starved;
there shall be no Gems of Science; there shall be a
hospital for destitute kings, those, at least, who do
not lose their heads, and no Vikrama——</p>

<p>A severe shaking stayed for a moment the Vampire’s
tongue.</p>

<p>He presently resumed. Briefly, building tanks;
feeding Brahmans; lying when one ought to lie;
suicide; the burning of widows, and the burying of
live children, shall become utterly unfashionable.</p>

<p>The consequence of this singular degeneracy, O
mighty Vikram, will be that strangers shall dwell
beneath the roof tree in Bharat Khanda (India), and
impure barbarians shall call the land their own.
They come from a wonderful country, and I am most
surprised that they bear it. The sky which ought to
be gold and blue is there grey, a kind of dark white;
the sun looks deadly pale, and the moon as if he were
dead.<a id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> The sea, when not dirty green, glistens
with yellowish foam, and as you approach the shore,
tall ghastly cliffs, like the skeletons of giants, stand
up to receive or ready to repel. During the
greater part of the sun’s Dakhshanayan (southern
declination) the country is covered with a sort of cold
white stuff which dazzles the eyes; and at such times
the air is obscured with what appears to be a shower
of white feathers or flocks of cotton. At other seasons
there is a pale glare produced by the mist clouds
which spread themselves over the lower firmament.
Even the faces of the people are white; the men are
white when not painted blue, the women are whiter,
and the children are whitest: these indeed often have
white hair.</p>

<p>‘Truly,’ exclaimed Dharma Dhwaj, ‘says the
proverb, “Whoso seeth the world telleth many a
lie.”’</p>

<p>At present (resumed the Vampire, not heeding the
interruption), they run about naked in the woods,
being merely Hindu outcastes. Presently they will
change—the wonderful white Pariahs! They will
eat all food indifferently, domestic fowls, onions,
hogs fed in the street, donkeys, horses, hares, and
(most horrible!) the flesh of the sacred cow. They
will imbibe what resembles meat of colocynth, mixed
with water, producing a curious frothy liquid, and a
fiery stuff which burns the mouth, for their milk will
be mostly chalk and pulp of brains; they will ignore
the sweet juices of fruits and sugar-cane, and as for
the pure element they will drink it, but only as
medicine. They will shave their beards instead of
their heads, and stand upright when they should sit
down, and squat upon a wooden frame instead of a
carpet, and appear in red and black like the children
of Yama.<a id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> They will never offer sacrifices to the
manes of ancestors, leaving them after their death to
fry in the hottest of places. Yet will they perpetually
quarrel and fight about their faith; for their
tempers are fierce, and they would burst if they
could not harm one another. Even now the children,
who amuse themselves with making puddings on the
shore, that is to say, heaping up the sand, always
end their little games with ‘punching,’ which means
shutting the hand and striking, one another’s heads,
and it is soon found that the children are the fathers
of the men.</p>

<p>These wonderful white outcastes will often be
ruled by female chiefs, and it is likely that the
habit of prostrating themselves before a woman who
has not the power of cutting off a single head, may
account for their unusual degeneracy and uncleanness.
They will consider no occupation so noble as
running after a jackal; they will dance for themselves,
holding on to strange women, and they will
take a pride in playing upon instruments, like young
music girls.</p>

<p>The women of course, relying upon the aid of the
female chieftains, will soon emancipate themselves
from the rules of modesty. They will eat with their
husbands and with other men, and yawn and sit
carelessly before them showing the backs of their
heads. They will impudently quote the words, ‘By
confinement at home, even under affectionate and
observant guardians, women are not secure, but
those are really safe who are guarded by their own
inclinations;’ as the poet sang—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <p>Woman obeys one only word, her heart.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">They
will not allow their husbands to have more
than one wife, and even the single wife will not be his
slave when he needs her services, busying herself in
the collection of wealth, in ceremonial purification,
and feminine duty; in the preparation of daily food
and in the superintendence of household utensils.
What said Rama of Sita his wife? ‘If I chanced to
be angry, she bore my impatience like the patient
earth without a murmur; in the hour of necessity
she cherished me as a mother does her child; in the
moments of repose she was a lover to me; in times
of gladness she was to me as a friend.’ And it is
said, ‘a religious wife assists her husband in his
worship with a spirit as devout as his own. She
gives her whole mind to make him happy; she is as
faithful to him as a shadow to the body, and she
esteems him, whether poor or rich, good or bad,
handsome or deformed. In his absence or his sickness
she renounces every gratification; at his death
she dies with him, and he enjoys heaven as the fruit
of her virtuous deeds. Whereas if she be guilty of
many wicked actions and he should die first, he
must suffer much for the demerits of his wife.’</p>

<p>But these women will talk aloud, and scold as the
braying ass, and make the house a scene of variance,
like the snake with the ichneumon, the owl with the
crow, for they have no fear of losing their noses or
parting with their ears. They will (O my mother!)
converse with strange men and take their hands;
they will receive presents from them, and, worst of
all, they will show their white faces openly without
the least sense of shame; they will ride publicly in
chariots and mount horses, whose points they pride
themselves upon knowing, and eat and drink in
crowded places—their husbands looking on the while,
and perhaps even leading them through the streets.
And she will be deemed the pinnacle of the pagoda
of perfection, that most excels in wit and shamelessness,
and who can turn to water the livers of most
men. They will dance and sing instead of minding
their children, and when these grow up they will
send them out of the house to shift for themselves,
and care little if they never see them again.<a id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> But
the greatest sin of all will be this: when widowed
they will ever be on the look-out for a second
husband, and instances will be known of women
fearlessly marrying three, four, and five times.<a id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> You
would think that all this license satisfies them. But
no! The more they have the more their weak minds
covet. The men have admitted them to an equality,
they will aim at an absolute superiority, and claim
respect and homage; they will eternally raise tempests
about their rights, and if any one should venture
to chastise them as they deserve, they would
call him a coward and run off to the judge.</p>

<p>The men will, I say, be as wonderful about their
women as about all other matters. The sage of
Bharat Khanda guards the frail sex strictly, knowing
its frailty, and avoids teaching it to read and write,
which it will assuredly use for a bad purpose. For
women are ever subject to the god<a id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> with the sugar-cane
bow and string of bees, and arrows tipped with
heating blossoms, and to him they will ever surrender
man, dhan, tan—mind, wealth, and body.
When, by exceeding cunning, all human precautions
have been made vain, the wise man bows to Fate,
and he forgets, or he tries to forget, the past.
Whereas this race of white Pariahs will purposely
lead their women into every kind of temptation,
and, when an accident occurs, they will rage at and
accuse them, killing ten thousand with a word, and
cause an uproar, and talk scandal and be scandalised,
and go before the magistrate, and make all the evil
as public as possible. One would think they had in
every way done their duty to their women!</p>

<p>And when all this change shall have come over
them, they will feel restless and take flight, and fall
like locusts upon the Aryavartta (land of India).
Starving in their own country, they will find enough
to eat here, and to carry away also. They will
be mischievous as the saw with which ornament
makers trim their shells, and cut ascending as well as
descending. To cultivate their friendship will be like
making a gap in the water, and their partisans will
ever fare worse than their foes. They will be selfish as
crows, which, though they eat every kind of flesh, will
not permit other birds to devour that of the crow.</p>

<p>In the beginning they will hire a shop near the
mouth of mother Ganges, and they will sell lead
and bullion, fine and coarse woollen cloths, and all
the materials for intoxication. Then they will begin
to send for soldiers beyond the sea, and to enlist
warriors in Zambudwipa (India). They will from
shopkeepers become soldiers: they will beat and be
beaten; they will win and lose; but the power of
their star and the enchantments of their Queen
Kompani, a daina or witch who can draw the blood
out of a man and slay him with a look, will turn
everything to their good. Presently the noise of
their armies shall be as the roaring of the sea; the
dazzling of their arms shall blind the eyes like lightning;
their battle-fields shall be as the dissolution
of the world; and the slaughter-ground shall resemble
a garden of plantain trees after a storm. At
length they shall spread like the march of a host of
ants over the land. They will swear, ‘Dehar Ganga!’<a id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>
that they hate nothing so much as being compelled
to destroy an army, to take and loot a city, or to
add a rich slip of territory to their rule. And yet
they will go on killing and capturing and adding
region to region, till the Abode of Snow (Himalaya)
confines them to the north, the Sindhu-naddi (Indus)
to the west, and elsewhere the sea. Even in this,
too, they will demean themselves as lords and masters,
scarcely allowing poor Samudradevta<a id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> to rule his
own waves.</p>

<p>Raja Vikram was in a silent mood, otherwise he
would not have allowed such ill-omened discourse to
pass uninterrupted. Then the Baital, who in vain had
often paused to give the royal carrier a chance of
asking him a curious question, continued his recital
in a dissonant and dissatisfied tone of voice.</p>

<p>By my feet and your head,<a id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> O warrior king! it will
fare badly in those days for the Rajas of Hindusthan,
when the red-coated men of Shaka<a id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> shall come
amongst them. Listen to my words.</p>

<p>In the Vindhya Mountain there will be a city
named Dharmapur, whose king will be called Mahabul.
He will be a mighty warrior, well skilled in the
dhanur-veda (art of war),<a id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> and will always lead his
own armies to the field. He will duly regard all the
omens, such as a storm at the beginning of the march,
an earthquake, the implements of war dropping from
the hands of the soldiery, screaming vultures passing
over or walking near the army, the clouds and the sun’s
rays waxing red, thunder in a clear sky, the moon
appearing small as a star, the dropping of blood from
the clouds, the falling of lightning bolts, darkness
filling the four quarters of the heavens, a corpse or a
pan of water being carried to the right of the army,
the sight of a female beggar with dishevelled hair,
dressed in red, and preceding the vanguard, the starting
of the flesh over the left ribs of the commander-in-chief,
and the weeping or turning back of the
horses when urged forward.</p>

<p>He will encourage his men to single combats, and
will carefully train them to gymnastics. Many of the
wrestlers and boxers will be so strong that they will
often beat all the extremities of the antagonist into
his body, or break his back, or rend him into two
pieces. He will promise heaven to those who shall
die in the front of battle, and he will have them
taught certain dreadful expressions of abuse to be
interchanged with the enemy when commencing the
contest. Honours will be conferred on those who
never turn their backs in an engagement, who manifest
a contempt of death, who despise fatigue, as well
as the most formidable enemies, who shall be found
invincible in every combat, and who display a courage
which increases before danger, like the glory of the
sun advancing to his meridian splendour.</p>


<p>But King Mahabul will be attacked by the white
Pariahs, who, as usual, will employ against him gold,
fire, and steel. With gold they will win over his best
men, and persuade them openly to desert when the
army is drawn out for battle. They will use the terrible
‘fire weapon,’<a id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> large and small tubes, which
discharge flame and smoke, and bullets as big as
those hurled by the bow of Bharata.<a id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> And instead
of using swords and shields, they will fix daggers to
the end of their tubes, and thrust with them like
lances.</p>

<p>Mahabul, distinguished by valour and military skill,
will march out of his city to meet the white foe. In
front will be the ensigns, bells, cows’-tails, and flags,
the latter painted with the bird Garura,<a id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> the bull of
Shiva, the Bauhinia tree, the monkey-god Hanuman,
the lion and the tiger, the fish, an alms-dish, and
seven palm trees. Then will come the footmen armed
with fire-tubes, swords and shields, spears and daggers,
clubs, and bludgeons. They will be followed by fighting
men on horses and oxen, on camels and elephants.
The musicians, the water-carriers, and lastly the
stores on carriages, will bring up the rear.</p>

<p>The white outcastes will come forward in a long
thin red thread, and vomiting fire like the Jwalamukhi.<a id="FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>
King Mahabul will receive them with his
troops formed in a circle; another division will be in
the shape of a half-moon; a third like a cloud, whilst
others shall represent a lion, a tiger, a carriage, a
lily, a giant, and a bull. But as the elephants will
all turn round when they feel the fire, and trample
upon their own men, and as the cavalry defiling in
front of the host will openly gallop away; Mahabul,
being thus without resource, will enter his palanquin,
and accompanied by his queen and their only daughter,
will escape at night-time into the forest.</p>

<p>The unfortunate three will be deserted by their
small party, and live for a time on jungle food, fruits,
and roots; they will even be compelled to eat game.
After some days they will come in sight of a village,
which Mahabul will enter to obtain victuals. There
the wild Bhils, famous for long ears, will come up,
and surrounding the party, will bid the Raja throw
down his arms. Thereupon Mahabul, skilful in aiming,
twanging and wielding the bow on all sides, so
as to keep off the bolts of the enemy, will discharge
his bolts so rapidly, that one will drive forward
another, and none of the barbarians will be able to
approach. But he will have failed to bring his quiver
containing an inexhaustible store of arms, some of
which, pointed with diamonds, shall have the faculty
of returning again to their case after they have done
their duty. The conflict will continue three hours, and
many of the Bhils will be slain: at length a shaft
will cleave the king’s skull, he will fall dead, and
one of the wild men will come up and cut off his
head.</p>

<p>When the queen and the princess shall have seen
that Mahabul fell dead, they will return to the forest
weeping and beating their bosoms. They will thus
escape the Bhils, and after journeying on for four
miles, at length they will sit down wearied, and revolve
many thoughts in their minds.</p>

<p>They are very lovely (continued the Vampire), as
I see them with the eye of clear-seeing. What
beautiful hair! it hangs down like the tail of the
cow of Tartary, or like the thatch of a house; it is
shining as oil, dark as the clouds, black as blackness
itself. What charming faces! likest to water-lilies,
with eyes as the stones in unripe mangos, noses resembling
the beaks of parrots, teeth like pearls set
in corals, ears like those of the red-throated vulture,
and mouths like the water of life. What excellent
forms! breasts like boxes containing essences, the
unopened fruit of plantains or a couple of crabs;
loins the width of a span, like the middle of the viol;
legs like the trunk of an elephant, and feet like the
yellow lotus.</p>

<p>And a fearful place is that jungle, a dense dark
mass of thorny shrubs, and ropy creepers, and tall
canes, and tangled brake, and gigantic gnarled trees,
which groan wildly in the night wind’s embrace.
But a wilder horror urges the unhappy women on;
they fear the polluting touch of the Bhils; once
more they rise and plunge deeper into its gloomy
depths.</p>

<p>The day dawns. The white Pariahs have done
their usual work. They have cut off the hands of
some, the feet and heads of others, whilst many they
have crushed into shapeless masses, or scattered in
pieces upon the ground. The field is strewed with
corpses, the river runs red, so that the dogs and
jackals swim in blood; the birds of prey sitting on
the branches, drink man’s life from the stream, and
enjoy the sickening smell of burnt flesh.</p>

<p>Such will be the scenes acted in the fair land of
Bharat.</p>

<p>Perchance, two white outcastes, father and son,
who with a party of men are scouring the forest and
slaying everything, fall upon the path which the
women have taken shortly before. Their attention
is attracted by footprints leading towards a place
full of tigers, leopards, bears, wolves, and wild dogs.
And they are utterly confounded when, after inspection,
they discover the sex of the wanderers.</p>

<p>‘How is it,’ shall say the father, ‘that the footprints
of mortals are seen in this part of the forest?’</p>

<p>The son shall reply, ‘Sir, these are the marks of
women’s feet: a man’s foot would not be so small.’</p>

<p>‘It is passing strange,’ shall rejoin the elder white
Pariah, ‘but thou speakest truth. Certainly such a
soft and delicate foot cannot belong to any one but
a woman.’</p>

<p>‘They have only just left the track,’ shall continue
the son, ‘and look! this is the step of a married
woman. See how she treads on the inside of her
sole, because of the bending of her ankles.’ And
the younger white outcaste shall point to the queen’s
footprints.</p>

<p>‘Come, let us search the forest for them,’ shall cry
the father, ‘what an opportunity of finding wives
fortune has thrown in our hands. But no! thou
art in error,’ he shall continue, after examining the
track pointed out by his son, ‘in supposing this to
be the sign of a matron. Look at the other, it is
much longer; the toes have scarcely touched the
ground, whereas the marks of the heels are deep.
Of a truth <i>this</i> must be the married woman.’ And
the elder white outcaste shall point to the footprints
of the princess.</p>

<p>‘Then,’ shall reply the son, who admires the
shorter foot, ‘let us first seek them, and when we
find them, give to me her who has the short feet, and
take the other to wife thyself.’</p>

<p>Having made this agreement they shall proceed
on their way, and presently they shall find the women
lying on the earth, half dead with fatigue and fear.
Their legs and feet are scratched and torn by brambles,
their ornaments have fallen off, and their
garments are in strips. The two white outcastes
find little difficulty, the first surprise over, in persuading
the unhappy women to follow them home,
and with great delight, conformably to their arrangement,
each takes up his prize on his horse and rides
back to the tents. The son takes the queen, and
the father the princess.</p>

<p>In due time two marriages come to pass; the
father, according to agreement, espouses the long
foot, and the son takes to wife the short foot. And
after the usual interval, the elder white outcaste, who
had married the daughter, rejoices at the birth of a
boy, and the younger white outcaste, who had married
the mother, is gladdened by the sight of a girl.</p>

<p>Now then, by my feet and your head, O warrior
king Vikram, answer me one question. What relationship
will there be between the children of the two
white Pariahs?</p>

<p>Vikram’s brow waxed black as a charcoal-burner’s,
when he again heard the most irreverent oath ever
proposed to mortal king. The question presently
attracted his attention, and he turned over the
Baital’s words in his head, confusing the ties of
filiality, brotherhood, and relationship, and connection
in general.</p>

<p>‘Hem!’ said the warrior king, at last perplexed,
and remembering, in his perplexity, that he had
better hold his tongue—‘ahem!’</p>


<p>‘I think your majesty spoke?’ asked the Vampire,
in an inquisitive and insinuating tone of voice.</p>

<p>‘Hem!’ ejaculated the monarch.</p>

<p>The Baital held his peace for a few minutes,
coughing once or twice impatiently. He suspected
that the extraordinary nature of this last tale, combined
with the use of the future tense, had given
rise to a taciturnity so unexpected in the warrior
king. He therefore asked if Vikram the Brave would
not like to hear another little anecdote.</p>

<p>This time the king did not even say ‘hem!’
Having walked at an unusually rapid pace, he distinguished
at a distance the fire kindled by the
devotee, and he hurried towards it with an effort
which left him no breath wherewith to speak, even
had he been so inclined.</p>

<p>‘Since your majesty is so completely dumbfoundered
by it, perhaps this acute young prince
may be able to answer my question?’ insinuated the
Baital, after a few minutes of anxious suspense.</p>

<p>But Dharma Dhwaj answered not a syllable.</p>
