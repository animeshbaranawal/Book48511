He tells us, however, that an account of these dialects may be found in the work called <i>Pingala</i>.</p>

				<p><a id="Footnote_13"/><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_13">[13]</a></span> The time was propitious to savans. Whilst Vikramaditya lived, Mágha, another king, caused to be written a poem called after his name. For each verse he is said to have paid to learned men a gold piece, which amounted to a total of 5,280<i>l.</i>⁠—a large sum in those days, which preceded those of <i>Paradise Lost</i>. About the same period, Karnáta, a third king, was famed for patronising the learned men who rose to honour at Vikram’s court. Dhavaka, a poet of nearly the same period, received from King Shriharsha the magnificent present of 10,000<i>l.</i> for a poem called the <i>Ratna-Malá</i>.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="footnote">
				<p><a id="Footnote_14"/><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_14">[14]</a></span> Lieut. Wilford supports the theory that there were eight Vikramadityas, the last of whom established the era. For further particulars, the curious reader will consult Lassen’s <i>Anthologia</i>, and Professor H. H. Wilson’s <i>Essay on Vikram</i>, (New) As. Res. ix. 117.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="footnote">
				<p><a id="Footnote_15"/><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_15">[15]</a></span> History tells us another tale. The god Indra and the King of Dhara gave the kingdom to Bhartari-hari, another son of Gandharba-Sena, by a handmaiden. For some time, the brothers lived together; but presently they quarrelled. Vikram being dismissed from court, wandered from place to place in abject poverty, and at one time hired himself as a servant to a merchant living in Guzerat. At length, Bhartari-hari, disgusted with the world on account of the infidelity of his wife, to whom he was ardently attached, became a religious devotee, and left the kingdom to its fate. In the course of his travels, Vikram came to Ujjayani, and finding it without a head, assumed the sovereignty. He reigned with great splendour, conquering by his arms Utkala, Vanga, Kuch-behar, Guzerat, Somnat, Delhi, and other places; until, in his turn, he was conquered and slain by Shalivaban.</p>

			<div class="footnote">
				<p><a id="Footnote_17"/><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_17">[17]</a></span> These duties of kings are thus laid down in the <i>Rajtarangini</i>. It is evident, as Professor H. H. Wilson says, that the royal status was by no means a sinecure. But the rules are evidently the closet work of some pedantic, dogmatic Brahman, teaching kingcraft to kings. He directs his instructions, not to subordinate judges, but to the Raja as the chief magistrate, and through him to all appointed for the administration of his justice.</p>

				<p><a id="Footnote_29"/><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_29">[29]</a></span> In the original, “Div’⁠—a supernatural being, god, or demon. This part of the plot is variously told. According to some, Raja Vikram was surprised, when entering the city, to see a grand procession at the house of a potter, and a boy being carried off on an elephant, to the violent grief of his parents. The king inquired the reason of their sorrow, and was told that the wicked Div that guarded the city was in the habit of eating a citizen per diem. Whereupon the valorous Raja caused the boy to dismount; took his place; entered the palace; and, when presented as food for the demon, displayed his pugilistic powers in a way to excite the monster’s admiration.</p>

				<p><a id="Footnote_30"/><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_30">[30]</a></span> In India, there is still a monastic order the pleasant duty of whose members is to enjoy themselves as much as possible. It has been much the same in Europe. “Représentez-vous le couvent de l’Escurial ou du Mont Cassin, où les cénobites ont toutes sortes de commodités, nécessaires, utiles, délectables, superflues, surabondantes, puisqu’ils ont les cent cinquante mille, les quatre cent mille, les cinq cent mille écus de rente; et jugez si monsieur l’abbé a de quoi laisser dormir la méridienne à ceux qui voudront.”⁠—<i>Saint Augustin, de l’Ouvrage des Moines</i>, by Le Camus, Bishop of Belley, quoted by Voltaire, <i>Dict. phil.</i>, sub v. “Apocalypse.”</p>

				<p><a id="Footnote_31"/><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_31">[31]</a></span> This form of matrimony was recognised by the ancient Hindus, and is frequent in books. It is a kind of Scotch wedding⁠—ultra-Caledonian⁠—taking place by mutual consent, without any form or ceremony.

				<p><a id="Footnote_45"/><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_45">[45]</a></span> The Hindus, like the European classics and other ancient peoples, reckon four ages:⁠—The Satya Yug, or Golden Age, numbered 1,728,000 years; the second, or Treta Yug, comprised 1,296,000; the Dwapar Yug had 864,000; and the present, the Kali Yug, has shrunk to 832,000 years.</p>

				<p><a id="Footnote_46"/><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_46">[46]</a></span> Especially alluding to prayer. On this point, Southey justly remarks (Preface to <i>Curse of Kehama</i>): “In the religion of the Hindoos there is one remarkable peculiarity. Prayers, penances, and sacrifices are supposed to possess an inherent and actual value, in one degree depending upon the disposition or motive of the person who performs them. They are drafts upon heaven for which the gods cannot refuse payment. The worst men, bent upon the worst designs, have in this manner obtained power which has made them formidable to the supreme deities themselves.” Moreover, the Hindoo gods hear the prayers of those who desire the evil of others. Hence when a rich man becomes poor, his friends say, “See how sharp are men’s teeth!” and, “He is ruined because others could not bear to see his happiness!”</p>

According to an eye-witness, Mr. F. Carey, the punishment was inflicted in two ways. Sometimes criminals were crucified by their hands and feet being nailed to a scaffold; others were merely tied up, and fed. In these cases the legs and feet of the patient begin to swell and mortify at the expiration of three or four days; men are said to have lived in this state for a fortnight, and at last they expired from fatigue and mortification. The sufferings from cramp also must be very severe. In India generally impalement was more common than crucifixion.</p>

Many violate these rules; yet to kill a Brahman is still one of the five great Hindu sins. In the present age of the world, the Brahman may not accept a gift of cows or of gold; of course he despises the law.

				<p class="ind">The Jains or Jainas (from ji, to conquer; as subduing the passions) are one of the atheistical sects with whom the Brahmans have of old carried on the fiercest religious controversies, ending in many a sanguinary fight. Their tenets are consequently exaggerated and ridiculed, as in the text. They believe that there is no such God as the common notions on the subject point out, and they hold that the highest act of virtue is to abstain from injuring sentient creatures. Man does not possess an immortal spirit: death is the same to Bramha and to a fly. Therefore there is no heaven or hell separate from present pleasure or pain.

The less cultivated Jains believe in a region of torment. The illuminati, however, have a sovereign contempt for the Creator, for a future state, and for all religious ceremonies. As Hindus, however, they believe in future births of mankind, somewhat influenced by present actions. The “next birth” in the mouth of a Hindu, we are told, is the same as “to-morrow” in the mouth of a Christian. The metempsychosis is on an extensive scale: according to some, a person who loses human birth must pass through eight millions of successive incarnations⁠—fish, insects, worms, birds, and beasts⁠—before he can reappear as a man.</p>

Vulgarly, it is a general term for mountebank vagrants, worshippers of Shiva. The Janganis adore the same deity, and carry about a Linga. The Sevras are Jain beggars, who regard their chiefs as superior to the gods of other sects. The Sannyasis are mendicant followers of Shiva; they never touch metals or fire, and, in religious parlance, they take up the staff. They are opposed to the Viragis, worshippers of Vishnu, who contend as strongly against the worshippers of gods who receive bloody offerings, as a Christian could do against idolatry.</p>
